#version 300 es // These is an OpenGL ES 3.0 Shader!

// This shader is the exact same as simple.vert, only it uses the newer OpenGL ES GLSL specification.

// In's and Out's of Vertex Shader in Version 3.0
// an 'in' inside of a vertex shader is an attribute
// an 'out' inside of a vertex shader is a varying


// An Attribute is a value pulled from a bound buffer on the GPU
// You set these up in the client code (our JS application)
// An attribute does not use the 'attribute' keyword in 3.0.
// We use the 'in' key word inside the vertex shader for attributes.

in vec3 aBarycentricCoord;

//In OpenGL vayring is replaced by in/out (vertex shader creates it as 'out', fragment uses it as an 'in')
out vec3 outColor;
out vec3 outBary;

// Uniforms do not change from one shader invocation to the next,
// these are set "constant" values that can be read by vertex and fragment shader
// if you want to use a uniform in the fragment shader then you must declare it at the top as well.
